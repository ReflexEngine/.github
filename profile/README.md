A high-performance, lightweight Lua runtime built in C# that combines the simplicity of Lua with the power of LibUV for asynchronous I/O. ReflexEngine delivers exceptional scripting capabilities for applications requiring both speed and flexibility.

## üöÄ Features

- **Blazing Fast Performance**: Optimized C# core with JIT compilation for high-speed execution
- **Minimal Footprint**: Efficient memory usage with .NET runtime optimizations
- **Asynchronous Architecture**: Built on LibUV and .NET's async/await for non-blocking I/O operations
- **Dual Engine Support**: Use standard Lua for compatibility or LuaJIT for performance-critical applications via native interop
- **Embeddable Design**: Easily integrate into existing .NET applications with a clean API
- **Extensible Framework**: Add custom functionality through C# modules or pure Lua libraries
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: First-class support for Windows, macOS, and Linux using .NET Core

## üìã Requirements

- .NET SDK 7.0+ (or latest LTS version)
- Git (for source code management)
- LibUV (for asynchronous I/O operations, included as a dependency)
