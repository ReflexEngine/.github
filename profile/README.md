A high-performance, lightweight Lua runtime built in C that combines the simplicity of Lua with the power of LibUV for asynchronous I/O. ReflexEngine delivers exceptional scripting capabilities for applications requiring both speed and flexibility.

## üöÄ Features

- **Blazing Fast Performance**: Optimized C core with LuaJIT support for near-native execution speeds
- **Minimal Footprint**: Less than 50MB base installation with minimal dependencies
- **Asynchronous Architecture**: Built on LibUV for non-blocking I/O operations and event-driven programming
- **Dual Engine Support**: Use standard Lua for compatibility or LuaJIT for performance-critical applications
- **Embeddable Design**: Easily integrate into existing C/C++ applications with a clean API
- **Extensible Framework**: Add custom functionality through C modules or pure Lua libraries
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: First-class support for Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üìã Requirements

- C99-compatible compiler (GCC 4.8+, Clang 3.4+, or MSVC 2015+)
- Make (alternative build option)
- Git (for source code management)
